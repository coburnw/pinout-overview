      #  The AVR DD Family uses the latest technologies from Microchip
      Technology, with a flexible and low-power architecture, including
      the Event System, intelligent analog features, and advanced digital
      peripherals. see the [datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/MCU08/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/AVR32-16DD20-14-Prel-DataSheet-DS40002413.pdf) for more info

      # It is recommended to place the decoupling capacitor on the same side
      of the PCB as the microcontroller. If space does not allow it, the
      decoupling capacitor may be placed on the other side through a via, but
      make sure to keep the distance to the supply pin as short as possible.
      If the board is experiencing high-frequency noise (upward of tens of
      MHz), add a second ceramic type capacitor parallel to the decoupling
      capacitor described above. Place this second capacitor next to the
      primary decoupling capacitor.

      # The CCL peripheral provides a number of Look-up Tables (LUTs).
      Each LUT consists of three inputs, a truth table, a synchronizer/filter,
      and an edge detector. Each LUT can generate an output as a user
      programmable logic expression with three inputs. The output is generated
      from the inputs using the combinatorial logic and can be filtered to
      remove spikes. The CCL can be configured to generate an interrupt
      request on changes in the LUT outputs.

      # The AVR32/16DD14/20 microcontrollers of the AVR® DD Family of
      microcontrollers are using the AVR® CPU with hardware multiplier
      running at clock speeds up to 24 MHz, with up to 32 KB of Flash,
      up to 4 KB of SRAM, and 256 bytes of EEPROM. The microcontrollers
      are available in 14- or 20-pin packages.
